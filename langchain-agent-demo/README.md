# langchain-agent-demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a LangChain agent that interacts with the DeepSeek model. The agent is designed to facilitate various tasks by leveraging the capabilities of the LangChain framework.

## Project Structure
```
langchain-agent-demo
├── src
│   ├── agent_demo.py        # Main implementation of the LangChain agent
│   └── utils
│       └── __init__.py      # Utility functions and classes
├── requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd langchain-agent-demo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the LangChain agent, execute the following command:
```
python src/agent_demo.py
```

## How It Works
The `agent_demo.py` file initializes the LangChain agent, sets up the necessary configurations, and defines the logic for interacting with the DeepSeek model. The agent can be customized and extended by modifying the code in this file or by adding new utility functions in the `utils` directory.
